This repository contains a very simple prototype of a "Candy Crush" clone.
The implementation is written in C++, using SFML as Graphic library.

To build the game you need to add all dll listed below in your building directory (for debug and release): you can download them from
SFML website.

Then you can build the project with Visual Studio (I used VS 2022).
